Jon is such a great cousin! He cooked me breakfast and took me to Ueda castle, where we played some handpan. Heâ€™s a fantastic handpan player, and he gave me a few tips on how to play better.

After traveling back to Tokyo on the Shinkansen, I met up with Justin and we went to Team Labs Planets. It was my second time and his first, and it was such a blast! They added an entirely new section since the last time I was there.
