[Saturday May 31st - Osaka to Nara to Kyoto](Saturday%20May%2031st%20-%20Osaka%20to%20Nara%20to%20Kyoto.md)

Well today is an extremely long June 1st for me - I spent the whole morning in Kyoto with Justin, travelled to Osaka to buy a suitcase and stuff it with Japanese candy, and made my flight back to Salt Lake City. My flight left in the evening for a 10 hour flight to San Francisco, and my flight to Salt Lake City will land in the evening on June 1st. Whew, long 39 hour day!

Justin and I visited the Arashiyama bamboo forest and Kiyomizu Dera this morning, and this visit was much less crowded than my last visit! We woke up at 4:42 a.m. (because why not ðŸ˜„) and got to the bamboo forest at 6 a.m. It was soooooo nice! It was raining while we were there, which made it misty and relaxing.

Well, as the generic tourist, I bought a suitcase in Japan and stuffed it with my luggage and a bunch of candy. Gotta bring back something to share with everyone!

It seems appropriate that my last meal before leaving Japan should be some good oleâ€™ salmon sushi ðŸ˜„

Well, Iâ€™m nearing the end of my travels - Iâ€™m here in the San Francisco Airport waiting for my flight to Salt Lake City. 

I had such a good time in Japan, this trip was absolutely the right thing to do. With it being my second trip to Japan, I had a better idea of what to expect and plan for. And with a big part of it being a solo trip, I had the freedom to do what I wanted when I wanted, without having to worry about other people. That was balanced with meeting up with Jon, Justin, and Tomo, who all made the trip so much more memorable. I love visiting Japan, and Iâ€™m almost certain that Iâ€™ll be going back at some point in the future. And even though I could probably stay in Japan for another month right now, Iâ€™m content with the ten days I had. It was absolutely worth it, and Iâ€™m looking forward to the next time I get to travel back to Japan!
