I took the Izu Panorama Park cable car to a cool park with great views of Mount Fuji!

Iâ€™ve been relaxing here in a hammock for the last while, updating my log for this Japan trip. I love just relaxing, not having to worry about the next thing Iâ€™m going to do. I have plans for the rest of the day, but I get to go at my own pace.

Shuzenji

Such a great time in Shuzenji! First thing I did here was find a hiking trail through the mountains, then I visited the Hakoyo sento, walked through the streets and bamboo trail, and finished by walking through the Shuzenji Temple. 

There was a nice old man at a booth on the street. We started talking a bit, and he offered me a piece of meat he was cooking. I donâ€™t actually know what the meat was, but it was delicious!

Oh man, the Kawazu Seven Waterfalls hike is an absolute highlight of this trip! I loved it so much. If that were the only thing I did all week, Iâ€™d be happy! I took so many pictures, and I recorded most of the hike on my GoPro.

Hehe, I stayed the night at a hotel in Kawazu, and I definitely pulled the dumb foreigner card. I couldnâ€™t find parking at the hotel, so I found another place to park. I looked on Google maps if it was paid parking, and I translated the signs around the parking lot to English using Google translate, and didnâ€™t see anything that said it was paid parking. So I parked there and walked down to the beach (which was pretty cool at night!). When I walked back to the car, someone was there - he was probably in his early 20s, and didnâ€™t speak a ton of English. And I donâ€™t speak much Japanese, so we communicated using my phone to translate. He told me it wasnâ€™t free parking, and helped me pay for it. He was so nice - I hate being the dumb foreigner, but you have to be a dumb foreigner before you can be a smart foreigner. ðŸ˜†
