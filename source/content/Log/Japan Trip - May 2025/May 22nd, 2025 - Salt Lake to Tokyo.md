I’m sitting on my flight to Los Angelos now, and I just finished up writing out my plan in [Japan Trip - May 2025](Japan%20Trip%20-%20May%202025). They just announced we’ll be landing soon, and the next leg of my journey will be the 11 hour flight to Tokyo. Good thing I downloaded the entire Shogun series to watch :)

I found a piano here at the LA airport, so I went ahead and played it to pass the time.
