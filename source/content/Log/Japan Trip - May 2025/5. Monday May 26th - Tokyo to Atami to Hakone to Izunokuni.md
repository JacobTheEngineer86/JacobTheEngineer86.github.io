I took the train from Tokyo to Atami, then picked up a rental car and drove to the motorcycle rental store near Hakone.

Ahhh, I’m in heaven right now. I rented a motorcycle a couple hours ago, and I’ve been riding around Lake Ashi. It’s indescribably beautiful here, and the weather is almost perfect. It’s cloudy, so I can’t see Mount Fuji at the observation points, and it’s cooler, but it’s not raining and I can sit outside without my jacket! It’ll be raining tomorrow and Wednesday, so I guess it’s a good thing I’m only renting the motorcycle for one day. I would absolutely love to spend a week here on a motorcycle!

And now I’m sitting down for some curry and sausage!

After the curry, I took a cablecar to Mount Mototsumiya, with a breathtaking view of Lake Ashi. It was cloudy, but we could see the top of Mount Fuji!

The person at the bike shop who helped me rent the motorcycle was so nice! We talked about motorcycle for a while, and he said he’s ridden every one of the bikes that they rent. Man, that would be awesome! When I returned the motorcycle, we talked a bit more, and I gave him a price of beef jerky. He’s such a nice guy!

After checking in to my hotel in Izunokuni, I took a night hike to the Nagoaka observation deck. It was great, just hiking alone, taking in the night sounds and the city lights.

Then I had some amazing sushi! The owners were so nice, and the food was fantastic!
