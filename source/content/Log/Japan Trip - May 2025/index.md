title: Japan Trip - May 2025
---
I’m so excited, I’ve been looking forward to this for so long! This’ll be my second time to Japan - last time I went with Ammon and Alec, which was an absolute blast! We hit the major attractions in Tokyo and Kyoto, and had amazing food. Now I’m heading back for a solo-ish trip, and I’m ready for another great time!

Here’s my plans as of now, we’ll see if they change! Except for the lodging, I’ve already paid for that :)

### Friday
Fly into Tokyo, do some shopping for motorcycle gear, and meetup with Justin for dinner.

## Saturday
Spend the morning around Ueno Park in Tokyo, head to Nagano to meetup with Jon, and stay with him for the night.

## Sunday
Spend the morning in Nagano, head back to Tokyo for Team Labs Planets with Justin, spend the evening around Tokyo Bay, and relax at the Toyosu Manyo hotel.

## Monday
Head to Atami and, weather permitting, rent a motorcycle for a ride around Lake Ashi! Rent a car, then spend the night in Izunokuni.

## Tuesday
Ride the Izu Panorama Park gondola, visit Suzenji (the Temple and the bamboo Forrest), hike the Kawasaki Seven Waterfalls trail, and spend the night in Kawasaki.

## Wednesday
Take the Mount Nesugata cable car, spend time on the beach (maybe go swimming if the weather is good!), visit some caves, and stay the night in Nishiizu.

## Thursday 
Visit some more caves, travel to Osaka, meetup with Justin, and hopefully visit Team Labs Gardens!

## Friday
Spend the day with Justin at Universal Studios! Then spend the night in Osaka.

## Saturday/Sunday
Spend the weekend with Justin! We still need to make a game plan, but we have a lot of options! We might head to Nara and visit the deer park, spend some time in Kyoto, and have some great food in Osaka! Then I’ll be heading back to Utah Sunday evening.


Intermixed with all of this will be enjoying the cities/towns, eating great food, and of course, visiting the onsens. I also want to take some time to build up my website. I have a fantastic week ahead of me, and I couldn’t be more excited!
