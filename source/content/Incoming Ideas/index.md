## My Gospel Philosophy

The purpose of the Gospel is to grow and change. This necessitates the need of agency, of free will, in our daily choices. 

What is the role of the Holy Ghost in this? 


## Personal Improvement

I need to change on a daily basis. I need to always honor the sense, to follow the promptings I receive. I commit wholeheartedly to this. 


## Dedication and Sacrifice

I seek not to avoid responsibility, but to seek it out. This is where true growth lies. 


## Nephi’s Psalm (2 Nephi’s 4:15-35)

Nephi has an understanding of what’s most important in this life - looking to the Lord. And he wants to share it with others.

Nephi is also a mortal man. He sins, he makes mistakes, and he feels guilty about that. He feels anguish and pain because of his sins. 

But he also trusts in the Lord. He trusts that the Lord will be with him through his hard times. He knows this because the Lord has already been with him through his hard times.

He isn’t afraid to communicate with the Lord. He understands that the Lord loves him and is willing to help. 

The Lord has shown him amazing things - the mysteries of the Kingdom, eternal and sacred principles -that he was commanded not to write - things that are available to me in the Temple.
