I’m sitting on my flight to Los Angelos now, and I just finished up writing out my plan in [[Japan Trip - May 2025]]. They just announced we’ll be landing soon, and the next leg of my journey will be the 11 hour flight to Tokyo. Good thing I downloaded the entire Shogun series to watch :)

There’s a piano here at the LA airport, so I went ahead and played it! I played Tribute by Jon Schmidt (No, not Tribute by Tenacious D, that would’ve been too epic).
