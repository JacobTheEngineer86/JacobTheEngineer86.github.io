The Gospel of Jesus Christ
It’s so easy for me to take this for granted, but when I slow down and really think about this, I’m in awe. I actually believe that God exists as my Heavenly Father, that Jesus Christ is his actual son who came to earth. That Christ setup his gospel and sacrificed himself for everyone, for me. That Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ actually appeared as Celestial beings to Joseph Smith and restored eternal truths to the earth. That John the Baptist, Peter, James, John, Elijah, Elias, Moses, and Christ himself came to earth and restored the necessary Priesthood keys to prepare all people for a higher state of living. 

There’s a mountain of ideas behind every sentence there, and I want to unpack and analyze everything I personally believe in greater detail - both to really define what I actually believe, and to reveal the pieces that don’t make sense, that need more thought, that need to be discarded, etc. I want to become truly self-aware. I want to know exactly what I believe and stand for and be able to confidently back up my ideas. And most importantly, I want to understand truth - eternal principles that guide everything.
