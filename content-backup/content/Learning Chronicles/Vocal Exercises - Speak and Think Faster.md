# Exercises to speak and think faster While maintaining clarity

## Three Exercises To Speak Faster
### Tongue Twisters
To speak quickly with clarity, your mouth muscles must be trained
- Collect tongue twisters
- Practice each tongue twister 5 times, increasing your speed each time

[[Tongue Twisters]]

### Speech Rate Per Minute
- Find a 300 word story
- Read out loud for 1 minute
- Mark in the story where you stopped
- Count how many words you were able to read
- Repeat, slowly increasing the number of words

If your mouth can’t keep up, go back to the tongue twister

### Breath Control (Hissing)
One key area that hurts speakers is using too much breath per word

You want to control the amount of breath exiting your mouth when you speak

- Take a deep breath
- Make a hissing sound until you run out of air, focusing on expelling a consistent amount of air

- Take a deep breath
- Count until you can’t
- Give every number the exact same amount of breath, especially the last

## Three Exercise to Think More Quickly

### Understand, Don’t Memorize
Seek to understand your area of expertise, not to memorize

- Study your area of expertise
	- Read
	- Listen to podcasts
	- Talk with people who understand it
	- Study it

### Conversational Frameworks
Create frameworks to help with communicating complex ideas

One great framework:
3-2-1 framework
- 3 steps
- 2 types
- 1 thing

Choose 1 of these parts of the framework

Experts don’t try to explain everything, they explain key concepts. Then if there’s more interest, they strategically go deeper, depending on questions. 

### Anxiety Reduction
Preparation is key
“If you are prepared you shall not fear” 

- Diaphragmatic Breathing
- Box breathing
